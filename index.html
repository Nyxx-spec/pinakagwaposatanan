                    <h4>IShowSpeed gets stunned after riding $70k Chinese car named Xiaomi SU7 Ultra that is supposedly faster than his Lamborghini</h4>
                    <p>
                        YouTube streaming star Darren "IShowSpeed" recently embarked on his highly-anticipated live tour of China on March 24, 2025. As with his other expeditions around the globe, the streamer walked around, visited stores, interacted with the locals, and ate some traditional food. In one particular instance, Darren found himself in the passenger seat of a Xiaomi SU7 Ultra, zipping through the roads of China.

                    <h4>WEST PHILIPPINE SEA</h4>
                    <p>The Philippines has long asserted its rights over certain islands and waters in some parts of the South China Sea, which it calls as West Philippine Sea. China, meanwhile, claims all of the South China Sea, which it justifies through its nine-dash line. In July 2016, the Philippines scored a landmark ruling in the Permanent Court of Arbitration that invalidated Beijingâ€™s massive claims over the South China Sea. Beijing, however, continues to ignore the decision. Other claimant-countries to parts of the South China Sea are Brunei, Malaysia, Vietnam and Taiwan.

                    <h4>Jayson Tatum injury: Celtics star rolls ankle, leaves game vs. Kings after landing on Domantas Sabonis' foot</h4>
                    <p>JBoston Celtics star Jayson Tatum is one of the NBA's most durable players. He has missed only six games this season and has never missed more than eight in a single season. However, freak accidents can happen in the NBA, and unfortunately, Tatum was hit with one in the third quarter of Boston's 113-95 win over the Sacramento Kings on Monday.

                        Tatum had the ball behind the arc and was defended by Kings big man Domantas Sabonis. Seeing the mismatch, Tatum went up for a 3-pointer. Sabonis attempted to contest him, but stuck his foot into Tatum's landing zone. Tatum landed on that foot and immediately crumpled to the floor in pain.
                        Tatum went to the locker room from there and did not return with what the Celtics called a left ankle sprain. After the game, Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla said Tatum seemed "to be doing OK" and was icing the ankle. Tatum was not made available to reporters but was not wearing a boot on the affected foot. 

                        The foul on Sabonis was a flagrant-1 based on a rule that came about as the result of a similar play. In the 2017 Western Conference finals, Kawhi Leonard got hurt when Zaza Pachulia closed out into his landing zone, so when a defender steps under an airborne shooter, it is now considered a flagrant. Tatum remained in the game for his free throws but exited from there.
